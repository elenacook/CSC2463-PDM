For my final project I have built a mini piano out of 5 buttons, assigned the pitches C, D, E, F, G. Along with each buttons assigned pitch is also an assigned color,
and each time a user presses a button, one of these 5 pitches is played and a color LED (red, white, green, blue or yellow) also lights up. Also on the screen is a starting 
title screen and when a button is pressed the screen lights up the color matching the LED and indicates the pitch name you are pressing. The purpose of this project
is to teach the user ear training by using colors to help memorize pitches.

Future developments of this project can include adding more buttons to make a whole 8 pitch scale, or even enough to simulate a piano, including semitones. Or another way to 
develop this further would be to assemble a way to transpose the button through different keys, so the user can practice ear training with multiple keys and not just C major. 
Future development may even include, solfedge indicators, and special indicators that show chord names created by the pitches pressed, to also teach music theory.
